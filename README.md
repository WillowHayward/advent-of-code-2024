I'm gonna use this to practice some rust.

Usage: `cargo run <day> <challenge>`


Day is a number corresponding to the challenge day, challenge is either `silver` or `gold` depending on if it is for the first or second challenge of that day.

User input should be placed in the `input` directory at the root of this folder, under the filename `<day>.input`
